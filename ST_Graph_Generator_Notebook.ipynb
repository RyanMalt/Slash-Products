    "# Slash Product Notebook\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook was created by Ryan Malthaner with algorithms from Garrett Tresch as a way of better visualizing, drawing, and working with slash products of st-graphs.  Current functionality allows for the slashing of arbitrary st-graphs together, as well as computing slash powers of a graph with itself.  All that is needed for this functionality is a numpy matrix of the adjacency matrix of the graph (be sure to put 0's on the diagonal), then the functions here will do the rest.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The function \"create_graph\" creates the graph from the given adjancency matrix and returns a networkx Graph object which has a multitude of algorithms and functionality built in that you can read about <a href=\"https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/introduction.html\">here</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function \"draw_graph\" draws the graph in a way where the nodes can be manipulated in the window where the graph is drawn.  These node positions can then be reused as shown in the code below, so that one does not have to constantly readjust the nodes time after time.  By default the positions of the nodes are printed out to the notebook so they can be reused between launches of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function \"comp_slash_power_verts\" computes the number of vertices for a slash power of a given st-graph.  This formula is given by $|V_G| + |E_G|\\cdot(|V_H| - 2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function \"comp_slash_verts\" computes the number of vertices for a slash product of two graphs.  This formula is given by $2 + (V - 2)\\cdot\\frac{E^{n} - 1}{E - 1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function \"slash_H_into_G\" takes an st-graph $G$ and replaces every edge of $G$ with a copy of $H$ i.e. it returns $G ⊘ H$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function \"slash_power\" takes an st-graph $G$ and performs the slash product of $G$ with itself $n$ times.  This is given by $G^{⊘(n)} = G^{⊘(n - 1)}⊘G$.  If one needs to compute multiple slash powers and retain them, it is much faster and better to use \"slash_H_into_G\" multiple times, as it will only compute exactly what is needed, whereas \"slash_power\" computes all the slash powers up until the iteration requested each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please enjoy this notebook, and we hope it is productive for your research.  Any requests for features, updates, or bugs can be sent to ryan_malthaner at tamu dot edu.  Thanks!"
